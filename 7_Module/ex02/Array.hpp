**  Class templates are like funtions templates. They are very util when we need a class to work with different data types.
**  Examples: Array, Queues, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, etc etc...
**
**  First, we need the template keyword to "define" the variable we will use for the data (as we did in the funtions templates).
